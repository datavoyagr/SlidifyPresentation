* Annual average statewide unemployment data used by this app was gathered from the Bureau of Labor Statistics http://www.bls.gov/lau/#cntyaa

* The data was combined into one table that includes data for the years 2000-2013.

* This application takes the information provided by the user and generates a plot of unemployment data by states and years.

## How to Use it
### Once you launch the application:

1. Use the slider in the left panel of the screen to select the range of years of unemployment data you would like to plot.

2. Use the drop down menu to select the states for which you would like to plot unemployment data. 

3. You can select as many states as you would like. You can also remove any state from the plot by simply clicking on the state you would like to remove and deleting it with the delete key on your computer.
